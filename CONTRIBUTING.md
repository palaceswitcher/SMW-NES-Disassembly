# Guidelines
- Ensure you're following the [style guide](https://github.com/palaceswitcher/SMW-NES-Disassembly/blob/master/style_guide.md).
- Ask before adding or changing frequently used RAM labels, especially if you're new. This can create a lot of merge conflicts.
- Summarize what you changed, if possible. A vague description is fine if you've changed a lot.
- Ensure the assembled ROM is identical to the final version's code. The `diff` scripts can verify this for you.
